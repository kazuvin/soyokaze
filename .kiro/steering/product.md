# Product Overview

## Product Overview

Soyokaze is a cross-platform mobile application built with Expo and React Native, designed to provide a complete development stack for modern mobile applications. The project is organized as a monorepo with TypeScript support, enabling efficient development across mobile, API, and schema management components.

## Core Features

- **Cross-platform Support**: Native deployment to iOS, Android, and Web from a single codebase
- **Type-safe Development**: Full TypeScript integration with Zod runtime validation and schema-driven development
- **Comprehensive Design System**: Built-in design tokens, theming, and styled components with light/dark mode support
- **Database Integration**: SQLite with sync-ready architecture for offline-first mobile experiences
- **File-based Navigation**: Expo Router implementation for intuitive and scalable navigation patterns
- **API Schema Management**: OpenAPI specification-driven development with automatic client code generation
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Vitest setup with UI testing capabilities and watch mode development
- **Monorepo Architecture**: Structured workspace management for coordinated development across multiple packages

## Target Use Cases

- **Mobile-first Applications**: Projects requiring native mobile experiences with web fallback support
- **Type-safe API Integration**: Applications needing robust client-server communication with generated type definitions
- **Design System Implementation**: Projects requiring consistent UI/UX across multiple platforms and team collaboration
- **Offline-capable Apps**: Mobile applications with local data storage and synchronization requirements
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Development teams needing fast iteration cycles with hot reload and comprehensive tooling

## Key Value Proposition

- **Developer Experience**: Complete development stack eliminates configuration overhead and provides immediate productivity
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end type safety from database schemas to UI components reduces runtime errors and improves code quality
- **Platform Consistency**: Single codebase deployment across all major platforms with native performance and platform-specific optimizations
- **Schema-driven Development**: API-first approach ensures consistent data contracts and enables parallel frontend/backend development
- **Maintainable Architecture**: Feature-based organization and clear separation of concerns supports long-term project scalability
